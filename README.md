# scikit-practice
My "natural" flow of learning scikit-learn, organized into categories based on the tools being practiced.

My main learning resources are the official scikit-learn documentation and the "Scikit-learn Crash Course - Machine Learning Library for Python" course
by freeCodeCamp.org(Vincent D. Warmerdam).
